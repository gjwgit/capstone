Capstone Machine Learning
=========================

Capstone is based on the idea that variables having a common/similar
focus can be grouped together to have greater impact on a model than
they would as separate inputs. Variables are then re-scaled and are
represented in groups. The groups have the effect of maintaining or
increasing their contribution to the model. When the process is
applied in a hierarchical manner, the model then requires less time
and resources to run, because it can achieve the same or better
results using fewer variables.
